The null hypothesis made is that the salary does not increase as the number of years worked does. This is to say that there is no direct positive relationship between the salary one earns and the years of working experience they have. The null hypothesis proposes that there is no statistical significance between the variables mentioned. Until statistical evidence proves otherwise, the null hypothesis is presumed true.
