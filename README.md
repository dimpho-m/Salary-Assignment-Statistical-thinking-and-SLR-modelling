# Salary Assignment: Statistical thinking and modelling

The null hypothesis made is that the salary does not increase as the number of years worked does. This is to say that there is no direct positive relationship between the salary one earns and the years of working experience they have. The null hypothesis proposes that there is no statistical significance between the variables mentioned. Until statistical evidence proves otherwise, the null hypothesis is presumed true.

The following SLR notebook makes use of a linear regression model, a supervised machine learning technique, to predict the future salaries of employees based primarily on the number of years they have worked. Because we are only focusing on the number of years worked as an influencing factor, this is known an univariate linear regression. Linear Regression is based on the straight line equation Y = mX + C.
